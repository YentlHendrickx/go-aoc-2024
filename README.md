# Advent of Code 2024 - Learning Golang

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenges. The primary goal of this project is to learn and practice Golang. If you come across this I encourage you to try out AOC yourself [here](https://adventofcode.com/).

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://golang.org/dl/).
2. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YentlHendrickx/go-aoc-2024.git
   cd go-aoc-2024
   ```
3. Navigate to the specific day's directory and run the code. For example, to run the code for day 1:
   ```sh
   cd day_01
   go run main.go
   ```

> **_NOTE:_**  AOC Rules strictly dictate against sharing inputs. Thus I have not included my inputs in this repository.

## Dependencies

Each day's solution may have its own dependencies specified in the `go.mod` file within the day's directory. Ensure you run `go mod tidy` to install the necessary dependencies before running the code.
